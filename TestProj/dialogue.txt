Sorry, we don't actually have that functionality yet.
Good luck, sweetheart. I know you'll do fine.
And home is just a phone call away.
Your brother is completely ignoring you, engrossed in playing on his handheld. At least someone is acting like normal.
We might even do your laundry for you.
Speak for yourself.
How soon can I come home? Is tomorrow good?
Well, let me check my busy calendar—
Shush, the locksmith is coming tomorrow, we can't let [pro_obj] come back before then.
Very funny.
[pro_Subj] think I'm kidding.
[pro_Subj] thinks I'm kidding.
Stop it, someone might overhear your smothering.
But [player_name]! How will we live without your sunny presence in our daily lives!
Be thankful he hasn't started weeping.
Remember Uncle Joe's wedding? God, that was a good one.
I'm an adult now. I can take care of myself.
Hmmm, remember that time you tried to microwave a pie plate?
Oh, or the time [pro_subj] ate an entire tray of brownies and couldn’t look at chocolate for over a month without gagging?
Or the time—
That's it, I'm officially disinheriting you. Can I disinherit my parents?
Remember who helped you steal those cookies last week.
Hey! Those were earmarked!
Remember the last time that [player_name] tried to earmark cookies, and you ate [pro_poss] cookies anyway?
[pro_Subj] brought it upon [pro_ref].
